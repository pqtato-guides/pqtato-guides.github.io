## Turn your old speakers into Bluetooth, Airplay, and Spotify receivers 

!!! info
    This project is from [Balena's blog](https://www.balena.io/blog/turn-your-old-speakers-or-hi-fi-into-bluetooth-receivers-using-only-a-raspberry-pi/). More information can be found there.

!!! note
    If you need help please create an issue on [their GitHub repository](https://github.com/balenalabs/balena-sound/issues).

### Required Hardware
* Raspberry Pi 4B, 3A+, 3B, or 3B+
* A microSD card
* Power supply (USB C with Pi 4B and Micro USB with 3A+, 3B, or 3B+)
* Speakers (you may need a 3.5mm audio cable)

### Required software
* Software to flash an SD card. I recommend [balenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher).
* Node.js
* A [balenaCloud](https://balena.io/cloud) account
* The [balena CLI tools](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

### Using balenaSound
#### With Bluetooth
Your balenaSound device should appear in the Bluetooth settings on your device. Connect to it and start playing some music.

#### With AirPlay
balenaSound supports Apple AirPlay. On a compatible device select balenaSound as the AirPlay device.

#### With Spotify Connect
**This only works with Spotify Premium.** balenaSound also supports Spotify Connect. In Spotify you should be able to select balenaSound under the devices menu.

!!! note
    Spotify will also show compatible Bluetooth and Airplay devices so balenaSound may show up 3 times. Look at the device's icon to identify which one is correct.
