# Setting Up
### This part of the guide will help you set up your Oculus Quest for sideloading.
To set up sideloading please follow the video guide below. You can stop watching at *5:31*. The links from the video are down below and you will also need a [compatible USB cable](usbcable.md). The SideQuest installation part of the video is slightly outdated though. Now SideQuest just has a simple installer just like any other app. SideQuest also had a complete redesign since the video was made but it should work about the same. If you need help please join the SideQuest Discord below.
##### *Tip: You can make the video bigger by pressing the :material-fullscreen: button.*
