# Guide to Sideloading on the Oculus Quest
## Setting it all up
First things first, you will need a compatible USB cable. You can find the one I recommend in the links section at the bottom. You will also need a computer. Before we begin I would like to say this guide is made for _Windows only_ but it could be adapted for other operating systems as well. <br/><br/>You will need to enable developer mode to be able to use an application called SideQuest. Don't worry, this won't do anything to your headset except for allowing you to install sideloaded applications and a few other small things we won't go over. To be able to do that please follow the video guide below. Once finish you can unplug the headset for now.<br/>

You should now be ready to install SideQuest. Earlier I mentioned SideQuest and you are probably asking what it is. SideQuest is mainly a huge library of applications not on the Oculus Store that you can install with sideloading. It can also install applications as APK files that you can download elsewhere. If you don't know what an APK it is just like an installer for a specific app on Android which your Oculus Quest uses. There are also a few other features I will not cover in this guide.<br/><br/>Anyways, to install SideQuest just download the Windows installer from the download page below. Once downloaded, please open it and install it as you normally would with any other application. Remember to read each part of the installer. It should now be in your start menu for you to open anytime.<br/>**If you need any help with SideQuest, sideloading, etc. please join the SideQuest Discord below.**
