# Guide to Sideloading on the Oculus Quest
!!! info
    This guide is work in progress.
## Setting it all up
Before we begin I would like to say this guide has been made for _Windows only_, but it could be adapted for other operating systems as well. Please follow the video guide below for instructions on how to sideload. You can find the needed links in the links section. The cable that they used is available right above the links.

!!! note
    Cas said that the cable is official but it is actually just recommended by Oculus if you are not using the Oculus Link cable.

_Remember you can make the video bigger by pressing the :material-fullscreen: button._<br/>

## Wirelessly Streaming your Oculus Quest using your PC
Using SideQuest from the setting up guide you can actually wirelessly stream your Oculus Quest to your PC. For example, you could record it with [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). This replaces using the cast feature and adds some extra settings. How it actually works is that SideQuest uses scrcpy to connect and show you the screen and SideQuest then configures scrcpy to work correctly with the Quest. Instructions for this can be found in the video guide below. Just like the setting up guide you find the links in the links section.<br/>

## Recommended USB Cable
This USB cable by Anker recommended by Oculus for Oculus Link can also be used for sideloading. Just choose your location for Amazon and you should be able to order one.

!!! info
    A shorter length should be fine if you do not plan to use Oculus Link with this cable.
