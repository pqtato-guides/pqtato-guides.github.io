What is a port? \u00b6 A port in port forwarding is simply a specific number that a service runs on. For example, most of the time websites use port 80 and a Minecraft server usually runs on port 25565. Let's say you have a Minecraft server. If you want other people to be able to connect you need to port forward which will give them permission to access the port the Minecraft server is running on and then connect. What is port forwarding? \u00b6 Port forwarding is the process is allowing a port to be accessed from other devices outside of your network. An example of a network would be your Wi-Fi. What is TCP and UDP? \u00b6 For information about TCP and UDP please see a guide on this by clicking here . How do I port forward? \u00b6 The process can be very different depending on your router. If you don't know your router is the box that provides your internet. For example, your router might say \"Netgear\" on it. There a lots of different companies making different routers so this guide will obviously not cover them all but if you are a developer then feel free to create a pull request on GitHub to help add to this guide. Below I have provided instructions for port forwarding on different routers. Google Fiber \u00b6 To port forward with Google Fiber it is actually more simple than most other routers in my opinion. Here are the steps. Go to fiber.google.com and sign in with your Google account. In the top right select \"Fiber Account\". Select \"Network\" on the left. Click on the device with the name of your network. It should look similar to the image below. Click on \"Advanced\". Click on \"Ports\". Click on \"Add port forwarding rule\". Select the device/IP in the dropdown. Select the service. If you don't know say \"Custom\". Fill out the necessary information. Click \"Apply\" and be patient for a few minutes. If it does not seem to work restart the network box in the \"Admin\" tab next to the \"Ports\" tab. TP-Link \u00b6 To port forward on TP-Link routers please follow the instructions on TP-Link support by clicking here . Select Routers WiFi Routers Port Forwarding/Virtual Servers and select the FAQ that applies to your router. It should say the model number on the router. Netgear \u00b6 To port forward on Netgear routers please click here . If you would like a router to be added feel free to create a pull request on GitHub. The GitHub repository can be found in the top right of this page.","title":"Guide to Port Forwarding"},{"location":"portforwarding/#what-is-a-port","text":"A port in port forwarding is simply a specific number that a service runs on.

Setting it all up \u00b6 Before we begin I would like to say this guide has been made for Windows only , but it could be adapted for other operating systems as well. Please follow the video guide below for instructions on how to sideload. You can find the needed links in the links section. The cable that they used is available right above the links. Note Cas said that the cable is official but it is actually just recommended by Oculus if you are not using the Oculus Link cable. Remember you can make the video bigger by pressing the button. Source: Cas and Chary VR If you need any help with SideQuest, sideloading, etc. please join the SideQuest Discord below. Wirelessly Streaming your Oculus Quest using your PC \u00b6 Using SideQuest from the setting up guide you can actually wirelessly stream your Oculus Quest to your PC. For example, you could record it with OBS . This replaces using the cast feature and adds some extra settings. How it actually works is that SideQuest uses scrcpy to connect and show you the screen and SideQuest then configures scrcpy to work correctly with the Quest. Instructions for this can be found in the video guide below. Just like the setting up guide you find the links in the links section. Source: Cas and Chary VR This video is actually just the streaming section of the setting up video above that was not included in this guide.
